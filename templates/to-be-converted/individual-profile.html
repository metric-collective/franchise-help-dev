                        <p>An iconic brand for over 50 years, AAMCO made its name as the world's largest transmission repair franchise. AAMCO locations now offer total vehicle care, meaning more repeat business for franchisees. No automative experience is needed to open an AAMCO - franchisees hire a team to perform the service work. More about the cost of owning a AAMCO Transmissions franchise below.</p>

Our legacy brand continues to thrive. Entrepreneur magazine has consistently ranked us as a top choice in its annual Franchise 500 rankings of franchise opportunities. We are also an iconic brand that customers know. We recently hired a marketing firm to measure how well the public knows our brand, and 92% of people surveyed recognized us as the leading brand for transmission repair. This is no accident: we’ve spent five decades buildi ng customer trust through our “Double-A-BEEP- BEEP-M-C-O” marketing campaigns.</p>
                        <p>Up until the early 2000s, we focused exclusively on being a transmission repair franchise. Today, transmission repair still accounts for the majority of our revenue, but we are beginning to experience a sea of change with our expansion into providing Total Car Care. In 2014, 60% of our customers visited us for Total Car Care. We expect that number to rise as we continue to advertise in national and local markets.</p>

                              <p>Now is a great time to invest in an AAMCO automotive franchise because we’ve developed a five-year plan to leverage our 50-year heritage and create lifelong customers for our AAMCO franchise owners. Up until the early 2000s, we focused exclusively on transmission repair. Today, transmission repair still accounts for the majority of our revenue, but we are growing revenue quickly by providing more Total Car Care. To enable franchisees to capture more maintenance and repair business, it was important for AAMCO to simplify the transmission repair part of the business and free up franchisees’ resources. That’s why we made a significant investment, partnering with sister company Global Powertrain Systems to build the state-of-the-art transmission remanufacturing facility adjacent to our new AAMCO University training center. The remanufacturing facility allows franchisees to send customers’ transmissions to us for reconditioning and repair. We then immediately ship an already- remanufactured transmission to the franchisee.</p>

AAMCO became a prominent and successful brand by dominating the transmission industry, but that only makes up about 6% of automotive repair spending. Now, we’re going after the other 94%.</p>
